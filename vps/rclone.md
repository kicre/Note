## Script installation

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

```shell
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash
```

For beta installation, run:

```shell
sudo -v ; curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta
```

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and won't re-download if not needed.
