# Do you think college shoud develop student's leadership skills, why or whynot? 

No , I don't think college should develop students' leadership skills.
Here are my thoughts.

First of all, in college, students take the initiative in their studies. So students should develop on their own according to their own interests, not the school train them. And self-development is more beneficial for students who are willing develop their leadership skills on their own.

Second, not everyone is cut out to be a leader. Blindly asking students who are not good or even socially inclined to develop leadership skills will not be better and is often counterproductive. It's important to teach to the individual.

Most importantly, our society does not lack people who are ambitious and willing to become leaders, but rather people who are down-to-earth and pragmatic in their work. In this impatient society, most of people is willing to be the leader from on high rather than the one being directed. If colleges also encourage people to become leaders, society will not become better.

That's all what I'm talking about.
